# Text Summarization& Topic Modelling Exploration

## Description
As part of the COMP0087 Statistical Natural Language Processing, I have explored text summarization and topic modelling method. In particular, I have investigated the performance of the TextRank based extractive text summarization model against weidely-adopted baselines LEAD and RANDOM. I also explored topic modelling method LDA.



## Instructions
1. [Topic Modelling](https://github.com/yirandu/NLP_COMP0087_TextRank/blob/master/Topic%20Modelling.ipynb), [TextRank based Text Summarization](https://github.com/yirandu/NLP_COMP0087_TextRank/blob/master/Extractive_TextRank.ipynb)
2. The Result of TextRank based text summarization can be tested through [this file](https://github.com/yirandu/NLP_COMP0087_TextRank/blob/master/Text_Summ_Test.ipynb)



## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is introduced by [Koupaee and Wang, 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09305), extracted from WikiHow. Most text summarization methods are built on news corpus with certain writing style, therefore, the WikiHow dataset introduces an opportunity to explore the application of text summarization methods on more generalized documents.
